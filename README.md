Project Overview:
This portfolio was built to showcase my skills, projects, and personality as a developer. It is designed with a modern, responsive layout and utilizes smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience. The key technologies used are Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, and AOS (Animate on Scroll) for frontend functionality and animations.

Key Features:
Hero Section:

Rounded Profile Photo: Displays my photo on the left side in a circular frame, adding a personal touch.
Dynamic Heading: “Hi, I’m Govind” text with a vibrant gradient animation.
Subtle Hover Animations: For visual appeal and interaction.
Navigation Bar:

Contains options for easy navigation to "About Me", "Skills", "Projects", and "Contact Us".
Clicking on any section smoothly scrolls the user to the respective section on the page.
Responsive Design:

Fully responsive, optimized for desktop and mobile screens. The layout adjusts seamlessly based on the device.
Animated Contact Form:

The "Contact Us" form slides into view with animations when clicked from the navbar.
The form includes fields for Name, Email, and Message, with an interactive Submit Button that changes color upon submission, providing visual feedback.
Section Animations (AOS):

Each section (About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact) is animated on scroll using AOS to create engaging transitions as users move through the page.
Gradient Design Elements:

The portfolio uses modern gradient backgrounds and buttons, blending colors like purples and blues for a sleek, vibrant look.
